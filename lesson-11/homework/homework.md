## **Puzzle 1: The Shifting Employees**

A company has a **rotational transfer policy** where employees **switch departments** every 6 months. You have an `Employees` table:

**Table: Employees**  


| EmployeeID | Name    | Department | Salary |
| ---------- | ------- | ---------- | ------ |
| 1          | Alice   | HR         | 5000   |
| 2          | Bob     | IT         | 7000   |
| 3          | Charlie | Sales      | 6000   |
| 4          | David   | HR         | 5500   |
| 5          | Emma    | IT         | 7200   |

### **Task:**

1. Create a **temporary table** `#EmployeeTransfers` with the same structure as `Employees`.
2. **Swap departments** for each employee in a circular manner:
   - **HR → IT → Sales → HR**
   - Example: Alice (HR) moves to IT, Bob (IT) moves to Sales, Charlie (Sales) moves to HR.
3. Insert the updated records into `#EmployeeTransfers`.
4. Retrieve all records from `#EmployeeTransfers`.

## **Puzzle 2: The Missing Orders**

An e-commerce company tracks orders in two separate systems, but some orders are **missing** in one of them. You need to find the missing records.

### **Given Tables:**

#### **Table 1: `Orders_DB1` (Main System)**


| OrderID | CustomerName | Product | Quantity |
| ------- | ------------ | ------- | -------- |
| 101     | Alice        | Laptop  | 1        |
| 102     | Bob          | Phone   | 2        |
| 103     | Charlie      | Tablet  | 1        |
| 104     | David        | Monitor | 1        |

#### **Table 2: `Orders_DB2` (Backup System, with some missing records)**


| OrderID | CustomerName | Product | Quantity |
| ------- | ------------ | ------- | -------- |
| 101     | Alice        | Laptop  | 1        |
| 103     | Charlie      | Tablet  | 1        |

### **Task:**

1. Declare a **table variable** `@MissingOrders` with the same structure as `Orders_DB1`.
2. Insert **all orders that exist in `Orders_DB1` but not in `Orders_DB2`** into `@MissingOrders`.
3. Retrieve the missing orders.

## **Puzzle 3: The Unbreakable View**

You are given a database that tracks **employee working hours**. The company needs a **monthly summary report** that calculates:

- **Total hours worked per employee**
- **Total hours worked per department**
- **Average hours worked per department**

### **Given Table: `WorkLog`**


| EmployeeID | EmployeeName | Department | WorkDate   | HoursWorked |
| ---------- | ------------ | ---------- | ---------- | ----------- |
| 1          | Alice        | HR         | 2024-03-01 | 8           |
| 2          | Bob          | IT         | 2024-03-01 | 9           |
| 3          | Charlie      | Sales      | 2024-03-02 | 7           |
| 1          | Alice        | HR         | 2024-03-03 | 6           |
| 2          | Bob          | IT         | 2024-03-03 | 8           |
| 3          | Charlie      | Sales      | 2024-03-04 | 9           |

### **Task:**

1. Create a **view** `vw_MonthlyWorkSummary` that calculates:
   - `EmployeeID`, `EmployeeName`, `Department`, **TotalHoursWorked** (SUM of hours per employee).
   - `Department`, **TotalHoursDepartment** (SUM of all hours per department).
   - `Department`, **AvgHoursDepartment** (AVG hours worked per department).
2. Retrieve all records from `vw_MonthlyWorkSummary`.
